Elements are the tiny, atomic topics that make up the awesome collection of 
skill content in LearningSherpa. All programs are composed of many Elements, 
and an Element represents the smallest piece a topic can be broken up into, 
and still be estimated to take up to 2 hours to complete.

These Elements are all contributed by the community, and are public & open-source. 
Use these, tweak these, do whatever you want as long as it's non-commerical.

## How to make content
- See if the topic is already created, or in process
- Fork this repo
- Use the content schema & style guide, and follow other Elements as examples
- Create your awesome content!
- Make sure it passes all the tests
- Make a pull request to this repo
- We'll review it, give you feedback, and merge it when it is ready!
- Now you're a contributor! Bask in the glory of your awesomeness!
