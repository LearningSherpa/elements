# Learning Sherpa skill micro repo

These are the tiny, atomic topics that make up the awesome collection of 
skill content in LearningSherpa. All programs are composed of many micros, 
and a micro represents the smallest piece a topic can be broken up into, 
and still be estimated to take up to 2 hours to complete.

These are all contributed by the community, and are public & open-source. 
Use these, tweak these, do whatever you want as long as it's non-commerical.
